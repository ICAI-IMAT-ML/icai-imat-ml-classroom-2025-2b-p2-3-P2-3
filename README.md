# Laboratory 2.3: Linear Regression

In this practice, you will implement and evaluate a linear regression model in `src/lab_2_3_LinearRegression.py`. Tasks:

1. **LinearRegressor Class**  
   - Implement `fit_simple` and `fit_multiple`  
   - Implement `predict`  
2. **Evaluation**  
   - Implement `evaluate_regression` to obtain R², RMSE, and MAE  
   - Implement `sklearn_comparison` to compare your model with scikit-learn’s  
   - Implement `anscombe_quartet` to test your model on Anscombe’s datasets  
   - Implement the rest of evaluation functions.
3. **Notebook**  
   - In `notebook/Lab_2_3_LinearRegression.ipynb`, answer the question about your results.

## Uploading Changes to GitHub

1. **Stage Changes**:
   ```sh
   git add .
    ```
2. **Commit Your Changes**:
    ```sh
    git commit -m "Implement kNN and evaluation functions"
    ```
3. **Push Your Changes**:
    ```sh
    git push 
    ```

Once you push your changes, the tests will be automatically executed. If all tests pass, you will receive 10 points. You can try as many times as you want until all tests pass.

Good luck!
